# Manual extension testing

## S05 visible preview and download

1. Run `pnpm build` and load `dist/` as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
2. Serve `tests/fixtures/visible-capture.html` over local HTTP and keep it as the active tab.
3. Open WebCap. Confirm the worker is connected and the tab status is **Có thể chụp**.
4. Select PNG and click **Tạo bản xem trước**.
5. Confirm the preview shows the four fixture quadrants, reports viewport dimensions multiplied by DPR, and does not include WebCap popup UI.
6. Close the popup after the preview appears, reopen WebCap, and confirm the same artifact preview is restored.
7. Click **Tải xuống**. Confirm the PNG opens, is non-empty, and the filename contains a sanitized page title, domain, and timestamp.
8. Repeat with JPEG and WebP. Changing the format after a preview should expose **Tạo lại định dạng** without recapturing the page.
9. Start a capture and click **Hủy chụp**. Cancellation must be announced without being presented as an unknown failure.
10. Close the popup while capture is in progress. Reopen it and confirm the session either resumes processing or restores the final preview.
11. Inspect extension IndexedDB `webcap-db`: source/output bytes remain `Blob` values in `artifacts`; `chrome.storage.session` contains metadata only under `webcap.visible-session`.
12. On a 125% zoom tab and DPR 2 display, repeat the capture and compare the reported pixel dimensions with `innerWidth × devicePixelRatio` and `innerHeight × devicePixelRatio`.
13. Open an unsupported URL such as `chrome://settings`; capture controls must remain disabled.
14. Use keyboard-only navigation and verify visible focus on format, capture, retry, cancel, and download controls.

## Automated S05 smoke

Run:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
pnpm test:e2e
```

The Playwright harness copies `dist/` to a temporary test directory and grants only the local fixture host permission. The production manifest is not modified. The smoke suite launches the bundled Chromium channel with an unpacked extension, opens the real action popup, validates preview pixels and dimensions, reopens the popup to verify restoration, downloads a PNG, and runs a DPR 2 / 125% zoom dimension check.
